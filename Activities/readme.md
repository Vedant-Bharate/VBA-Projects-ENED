# DESCRIPTION
Welcome to the ENED VBA Activities repository! In this repository, you'll find a collection of tasks and assignments designed to enhance your skills in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), specifically tailored for your Engineering Education (ENED) coursework.

## About
The tasks and assignments provided in this repository are aimed at strengthening your proficiency in VBA, a powerful programming language used to automate tasks and analyze data in Microsoft Excel. Each task is accompanied by a detailed description provided in PDF format, outlining the objectives and requirements to be fulfilled.

## Getting Started
To begin working on the tasks, please follow these steps:

1. **Review Task Descriptions**: Navigate to the [Tasks](Tasks) folder and go through the uploaded PDF files to understand the requirements and objectives of each task thoroughly.

2. **Download Starter Files**: Download the provided Excel files from the [Starter Files](./Starter%20Files) folder. These files serve as the starting point for your work on each task, providing the necessary data and structure to begin coding in VBA.

### Solutions
The solutions to the tasks are posted in the [Solutions](Solutions) folder. In this folder, you'll find two types of files:

1. **Excel Files**: The complete Excel files containing all the data and macros embedded in them. These files showcase the fully implemented solutions to each task.

2. **.bas Files**: These files contain only the VBA code used in the Excel files. You can review the VBA code separately to understand the implementation details of each solution.
